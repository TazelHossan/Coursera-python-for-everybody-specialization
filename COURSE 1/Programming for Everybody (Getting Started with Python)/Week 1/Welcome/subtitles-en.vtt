00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.560
Hello, my name is Charles Severance.

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.820
I'm a Clinical Professor at

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.130
the University of Michigan
School of Information,

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.600
and I'm your instructor
for this course.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.020
This course is a
little different than

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.430
every programming
course that I've

7
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.110
ever taught, or I've ever taken.

8
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.910
This course is dedicated to

9
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.040
the notion that
every single person

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.630
on the planet needs
to be able to write

11
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.390
programs and can write programs.

12
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.195
You do not have to
have a bunch of math.

13
00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.440
I do not expect math.

14
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.520
I do not expect that you've taken

15
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.885
any other programming classes.

16
00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:34.805
I don't expect you know
anything about computers.

17
00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.830
I think no matter
what your background

18
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.065
is, you can program.

19
00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:40.790
That's why it's called
Programming for

20
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.130
Everybody. I have
a couple of goals.

21
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.740
Certainly, I want to
teach you how to program.

22
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.750
But actually what I
really want to do

23
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.625
is teach you how to take
a programming class

24
00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.530
because it turns out that most of

25
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.350
the other programming classes
in the world are kind of difficult.

26
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.785
They sort of assume way too
much and the teachers sort of

27
00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:58.330
don't even realize how much

28
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.110
they're expecting from students.

29
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.720
So when you're done
with this class,

30
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.855
you can go and take
another beginning class.

31
00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:07.775
And that way you have this as an

32
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:10.110
on-ramp to all of your
programming activity.

33
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.340
And so I'm really excited
that you're here.

34
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.390
Another thing that I
want to do is I want

35
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.965
to teach you how to be a mentor.

36
00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:18.800
I want to teach you how to
be a teacher of programming.

37
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.140
So I want you to
take all my ideas,

38
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.195
and I want to you to
help the next person.

39
00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:25.865
And the reason is that
learning how to program

40
00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:30.930
is a little sort of foggy,

41
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.230
uncomfortable, you
get stuck on things,

42
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.020
and those things aren't
hard, I assure you.

43
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.340
But when you're stuck on them,

44
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.750
they feel really hard.

45
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270
And the best way to get unstuck

46
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.815
is get some help from somebody.

47
00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:44.480
And if they're sitting
right next to you,

48
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.710
and they can go, "Oh look.

49
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.770
You've just got to like add
two spaces and it's fine."

50
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.230
And you're like, "Oh, that
saved me a lot of time."

51
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.085
So I want you to be willing
to help somebody else.

52
00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.170
Another thing that's
important to me is

53
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.975
that I want to create
more teachers.

54
00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.030
Whether they're at universities,
or community colleges,

55
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.870
or high schools, or
even middle schools,

56
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.830
or in professional situations.

57
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.780
I have given you all of

58
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.360
the materials for
this course at a website.

59
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.400
They're all licensed
under Creative Commons,

60
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.635
the slides, the autograders.

61
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.264
I want you to in a sense
adopt this textbook,

62
00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.350
and then use
my teaching kit so that

63
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.735
you can become a teacher
of this material,

64
00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:25.220
because I don't think that I'm

65
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.610
naturally the only
teacher of this.

66
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.690
And in particular, if you don't

67
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.295
speak English as
your first language,

68
00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:34.790
you might want to teach

69
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.680
this class in
your native language.

70
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.720
And so that's another reason
that I give you

71
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.070
these materials with

72
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.910
a free and open copyright
that you can take them,

73
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.085
you can translate them
into your language.

74
00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:48.260
The book has been translated
into several languages.

75
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.670
And that's really exciting.

76
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.800
Those books that have
been translated are

77
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.215
usually free and available.

78
00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.820
You can get print copies
that are very

79
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.190
inexpensive and
all the ecopies are free.

80
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.520
And so this notion that
I create this kit,

81
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.665
that you can then change the kit.

82
00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.240
You don't have to
just take my class.

83
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.680
You can change it and you can

84
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.995
make it work for you locally.

85
00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:12.725
And really, the overall
goal of this is

86
00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.770
more than just like teaching
you one programming class.

87
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.505
I think that the entire
technology marketplace, and

88
00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.460
to some degree all of business in

89
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.590
general is becoming
increasingly technical.

90
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.285
And too many people, young, old,

91
00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:33.390
regardless of education,
are shut out of

92
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.660
this sort of club where you

93
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.105
need to know something
about technology.

94
00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:42.410
And so that's why we're
Programming for Everybody.

95
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.045
Regardless of geography,
regardless of ability to pay,

96
00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:49.715
regardless of if you
have any disabilities,

97
00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:53.345
I want Programming for
Everybody to be everybody.

98
00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.970
I want when to just expand

99
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.470
forever the number of

100
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.985
people who are capable
of programming.

101
00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:02.525
It's an open
self-sustaining ecosystem,

102
00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:06.065
and have you be part of
that self-sustaining ecosystem.

103
00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.135
So again, welcome to the class.

104
00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:09.650
I look forward to what
you do and I look

105
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.150
forward to seeing you
throughout the class.
